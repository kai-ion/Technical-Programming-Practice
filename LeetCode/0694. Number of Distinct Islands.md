# [694. Number of Distinct Islands ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-islands)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>You are given an <code>m x n</code> binary matrix <code>grid</code>. An island is a group of <code>1</code>&#39;s (representing land) connected <strong>4-directionally</strong> (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.</p>

<p>An island is considered to be the same as another if and only if one island can be translated (and not rotated or reflected) to equal the other.</p>

<p>Return <em>the number of <b>distinct</b> islands</em>.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

The brute force solution would just to be for everytime we find an island, we imagine that its pushed to the left most
corner in the map, then add those coordinates onto a set, and we repeatedly do this for all the islands and return the
len of islands. However the bottleneck is comparing the each unique map, for we might need to compare each grid by grid.

To optimize, instead of recording a map, we can record the paths taken to record an island as a string, and then add
that to our set instead

###Explanationa###
"""
We are going to have two sets, one to store islands already visited for our dfs, and another set to store the unique
paths we took to find an island, Then we will iterate through every grid, looking for the start of an island,
then initiate an empty path list, and do our dfs where we search the 4 directions of the current grid, checking
if the directions are in bound, and if it has already been visited. If not, we add it to visited, and then add the 
current direction taken to our path, and recursively call the 4 directions. Once all 4 directions are searched, we can
add a marker for completed. Then add path to set. THen return len of set
