# [127. Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/description/)
### Question:
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:
1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.

Note:
* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.

```
Example 1:

Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

Example 2:

Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: 0
```
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

### Thinking:
* This can be solved with graph traversal by mapping our neighbors with one letter difference patterns. 
        We can create a pattern dictionary of neighbors with one letter different from current word. For example
        hot and dot have a matching pattern of *ot, there for they're in each other's neighbor dict. Then we can
        have traverse thru each neighbors while keeping a visited set till we reach the endword or return 0

        """

        ###Explanation###
        """
        To create the neighbor list graph, we first iterate thru each word in the wordlist, then we iterate thru each 
        letter in the word list and replace the letter with a * and add the new pattern word as a key in our dictionary
        and append the current word to neighbor list with the key as the new pattern word, use a default key dict so
        we dont have to implement if key already exist.
        Next we create a visited set and que initiated with begin word. we iterate thru the q while its not empty
        and iterate thru the length of the q because we only want to look thru the current que of neighbors (as we 
        iterate thru we may add more neighbors to the que) because traversing to the neighbor of neighbor is two 
        iterations (we return how many iteration or looking for next neighbor we went thru).
        inside the iteration of current neighbor list, we first check if current neighbor is equal to beginword, if so 
        we return res. Else we go thru each letter of current neighbor and replace the letter with * to match with 
        our pattern neighbor dict. If it is in the dict and not in visited, we add the current neighbor to visited and
        to the que. once we finish visiting this layer of neighbors, we increase res by 1 because we are visiting the
        next layer of neighbors
        if we exit the q iteration without finding the endword, we can return 0 because it is not reachable
