# [2055. Plates Between Candles](https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles)


## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> string <code>s</code> consisting of characters <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> and <code>&#39;|&#39;</code> only, where a <code>&#39;*&#39;</code> represents a <strong>plate</strong> and a <code>&#39;|&#39;</code> represents a <strong>candle</strong>.</p>

<p>You are also given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> 2D integer array <code>queries</code> where <code>queries[i] = [left<sub>i</sub>, right<sub>i</sub>]</code> denotes the <strong>substring</strong> <code>s[left<sub>i</sub>...right<sub>i</sub>]</code> (<strong>inclusive</strong>). For each query, you need to find the <strong>number</strong> of plates <strong>between candles</strong> that are <strong>in the substring</strong>. A plate is considered <strong>between candles</strong> if there is at least one candle to its left <strong>and</strong> at least one candle to its right <strong>in the substring</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, <code>s = &quot;||**||**|*&quot;</code>, and a query <code>[3, 8]</code> denotes the substring <code>&quot;*||<strong><u>**</u></strong>|&quot;</code>. The number of plates between candles in this substring is <code>2</code>, as each of the two plates has at least one candle <strong>in the substring</strong> to its left <strong>and</strong> right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>an integer array</em> <code>answer</code> <em>where</em> <code>answer[i]</code> <em>is the answer to the</em> <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> <em>query</em>.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

By intuition you can brute force and just count the number of plates in between each plate, but this will
cause a lot of redundant work. Realizing it is repeated work, we can use a prefix sum technique by using 3 lists
to keep track of the closest left and right candle to current index and the total count of candles seen before 
this index. Then we can just calculate the number of plates by taking the difference in distance between
the closest left and right candle and subtracting by the number of candles between the left and right candles.

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def platesBetweenCandles(self, s: str, queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        ###Summary###
        """

        """
        Time: O (n + q), n - len of s, q number of queries
        Space: O (n + q), n - len of s, q number of queries
        """

        ###Explanation###
        """
        We will use 3 lists to keep and updated list of prefix sum lists so we can keep track of the left and right closest
        candle to current index and the number of candles seen prior to current index. To keep the left closest candle,
        we will iterate though s and populate the left prefix sum list with last seen candle index position (initiated at -1,
        because s could start with plates and no candle to the left) then whenever we see the first candle we will keep track
        of its position and populate the next indexes in the left prefix sum with that candle's position until end of s.
        With the right prefix sum, we can do the samething but in reverse order.
        To create a candle count prefix sum list, we can just keep a counter of how many candle has been seen (initiated at 0),
        and populate the list with current count.
        Then to query the results, we can get the left and right closest candle to left and right position in the query,
        then check for two edge cases, there could be no candles in range or the right position is to the left of the left
        position, we can return 0 in that case. Else we can get the number of candles in range by taking the difference
        between left and right candle count + 1, then get the plate count by taking the difference between left and right 
        closest candles in range subtract by the number of candles in range
