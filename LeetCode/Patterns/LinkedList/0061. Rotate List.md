## [61. Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/description/)

### Question:
Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

```
Example 1:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL, k = 2
Output: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 5->1->2->3->4->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 4->5->1->2->3->NULL

Example 2:

Input: 0->1->2->NULL, k = 4
Output: 2->0->1->NULL
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
rotate 2 steps to the right: 1->2->0->NULL
rotate 3 steps to the right: 0->1->2->NULL
rotate 4 steps to the right: 2->0->1->NULL
```

### Thinking:
* Method:
	* Find the length of the linked list to calculate the exact point of rotation
    * Then we would set the linked list into a loop with the old tail connecting to head
    * Then cut off the linked list at point of rotation
    
### **Python3**

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        #linked list rotation
        #time: O (n)
        #space: O (1)
        ###summary##
        #Find the length of the linked list to calculate the exact point of rotation
        #then we would set the linked list into a loop with the old tail connecting to head
        #then cut off the linked list at point of rotation

        ###explanation###
        #get rid of edgecases first
        #we would first iterate thru the linked list to find the tail and the length of the linked list
        #we would then set the linked list into a loop by connected the tail with the head, 
        #while keeping the location of head and tail
        #then we would iterate thru the linked list from head length - k - 1 times, this is the exact point of cut off
        #we can then set this node as the new tail of the linked list and return the new head, which is the next node

        ###pseudo code###
        ##edgecase 
        #if not head
            #return None
        #if not head.next
            #return head

        #set length to 1 and oldtail to head

        ##need to get length of the tail of linkedlist
        #iterate thru the linkedlist while oldtail still has next
            #set oldtail to oldtail.next
            #add 1 to length

        #calculate how many node we need to move down in the linkedlist by taking k modula by length
        #if the new k is = to 0, no rotation is needed
            #return head
        
        ##loop the linkedlist
        #set oldtail.next to head
        
        ##need to get the new tail
        #set new tail to head
        #iterate length - l - 1 times to get to new tail
            #set newtail to newtail.next
        
        #the newhead would be newtail.next
        ##break the linked list at new tail
        #set newtail.next = Non

        #return new head

        ###Code###
        if not head:
            return None
        
        if not head.next:
            return head
        
        length, oldTail = 1, head
        while oldTail.next:
            oldTail = oldTail.next
            length += 1
        
        k = k % length
        if k == 0:
            return head
        
        oldTail.next = head

        newTail = head
        for i in range(length - k - 1):
            newTail = newTail.next
        
        newHead = newTail.next

        newTail.next = None

        return newHead
```
