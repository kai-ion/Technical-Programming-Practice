## [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/)

### Question
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).
```
Example:

Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

### Thinking:
* Method 1: have a sliding window that will keep expanding when you do not have all the matching character in the cur window. Then contract the sliding window on the left while all the matching character are present in the cur window. Once you dont have all the matching characters again, you can again expand on the right

### **Python3**

```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        #Sliding window
        #Time: O(S + T), s = len s, t = len t
        #SPace: O(S + T)
        ###Summar###
        #have a sliding window that will keep expanding when you do not have all the matching character in the cur window
        #then contract the sliding window on the left while all the matching character are present in the cur window
        #Once you dont have all the matching characters again, you can again expand on the right

        ###optimization###
        #you can keep a list of where all characters in s are present in t, then when we do the sliding windows method,
        #we can just start with the list to narrow down our search a little

        ###explanation###
        #We will first keep a count dict of t, and an empty window dict.
        #and a have and a need var for how many matches we get and need
        #then we will have a left and right pointer to for a sliding window
        #we start iterating thru string s, and check if the cur character is what we need, 
        #if it is we can update our window and increase have if the window[current letter] matches count[current letter]
        #slowly increase the right pointer for the window and repeat, if the have matches need, 
        #it means our window is met. Now we start contracting the window on the left
        #as we decrease our window on the left side, 
        #we decrease window[current letter] and decrease have if the window no longer matches count
        #once our have does not match need, we can begin expanding again and repeat this process.
        #our res should be recorded to the min res everytime our window matches count

        ###psudocode###
        ##edgecase when s or t is empty
        #if not s or not t:
            #return ""
        
        ##start a countT dict and an empty window dict
        #countT = Counter(t)
        #window = {}
        
        ##set have, need, res tuple, and resLen to inf
        #have, need = 0, len(countT)
        #res, resLen = [-1, -1], float("inf")

        ##set a left right pointer
        #left = 0, right can be initated at the loop

        ##interate from r to len(s)
        #for right in range(len(s))
            ##get current character
            #c = s[right]

            ##update window, use the get method for dict and a default value of 0
            #window[c] = window.get(c, 0) + 1

            ##update our have counter, check if this current character is in count dict, and if our window matchs counter
            #if c in counterT and window[c] == counterT[c]
                #have += 1


            ##once our have matches our need, we need to contract the window in a while loop
            #while have == need and left <= right
                ##get the character at the left pointer
                #c = s[left]

                ##Save our smallest window
                #if right - left + 1 < resLen
                    #res = [left, right]
                    #resLen = right - left + 1
                
                ##remove left character from our window
                #window[c] -= 1

                ##update have if character count in c is less than character count in counter
                #if c in counterT and window[c] < counterT[c]
                    #have -= 1
                
                ##move left pointer
                #left -= 1
            ##once we exit out of this while loop we go back to expanding the right pointer of windows
        
        ##set our left and right to what we have in our res tuple
        #left, right = res

        ##we return empty string is resLen is inf else return s[left : right + 1]
        #return "" if resLen == float("inf") else s[left : right + 1]
