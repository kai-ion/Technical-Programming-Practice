## [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/description/)

### Question
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

```
Example 1:

Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.


Example 2:

Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.


Example 3:

Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### Solution
* Method 1: Sort + Greedy. We can simply sort the intervals so we can compare the start time of cur interval to end time of prev interval. if the start time is less than the end time, we know there is an overlap and we can inc our ans by 1. Then we can just set the prev end time to the smaller end time, because we would typically remove the interval with a longer end time so there wont be another overlap. note - we dont have to change prev End time if the list is sorted by end time instead. Repeat this process till we reach the end of the list. 

#### **Python3**
  ```python
  class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        #Interval Sorting solution
        #Time: O (n log n), sorting
        #Space: O (n), sorting

        ###Summary###
        #We can simply sort the intervals so we can compare the start time of cur interval to end time of prev interval
        #if the start time is less than the end time, we know there is an overlap and we can inc our ans by 1
        #then we can just set the prev end time to the smaller end time, 
        #because we would typically remove the interval with a longer end time so there wont be another overlap
        #note - we dont have to change prev End time if the list is sorted by end time instead
        #repeat this process till we reach the end of the list. 

        ###Exaplanation###
        #first we have to sort the intervals so we can compare start and end times of the intervals
        #then we will set a prev end time for the first interval because we dont need to compare it to another interval
        #as we start interating starting from the second interval, we compare the start time to the prevEnd time
        #if start time is less than prevEnd time there is an overlap, 
        #we would inc ans by 1 and set the prevEnd time to the min of cur Interval endTime and prevEnd time,
        #because we typically remove the interval with a bigger end time so theres less chance of another overlap
        #note - we dont have to change prev End time if the list is sorted by end time instead
        #if there is no overlap, we can simply set the prevEnd time to the curEnd time

        ###Pseudo Code###
        #sort interval with intervals.sort()
        #call a res initiated with 0

        #set prevEnd to the end time of the first interval at intervals[0][1]
        #Iterate thru the intervals list starting at the first interval and get the start and end times

            ##check if there is no overlap
            #check if currentStart time is greater than or equal to the prevEnd time
                ##no overlap
                #set prevEnd time to current end time
            #else there is overlap
                #inc res by 1
                #set prevEnd to the min of current end time and prevEnd
                #note - we dont have to change prev End time if the list is sorted by end time instead
        
        #return res

        ###code###
        intervals.sort()
        res = 0

        prevEnd = intervals[0][1]
        for start, end in intervals[1 : ]:
            if start >= prevEnd:
                prevEnd = end
            else:
                res += 1
                prevEnd = min(prevEnd, end)
        
        return res




  ```
