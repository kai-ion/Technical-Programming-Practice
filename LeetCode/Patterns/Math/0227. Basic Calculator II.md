# [227. Basic Calculator II](https://leetcode.com/problems/basic-calculator-ii/description/)

### Question
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, 4 operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

```
Example 1:

Input: "3+2*2"
Output: 7

Example 2:

Input: " 3/2 "
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
Output: 5
```

### Thinking:
* Method 1ï¼šSimply go thru the string and add each number to a curr number until we see an operand, 
        then perform the operation.
        if the operand is a * or / we will have to take a prev number and perform the operation with the cur number.
        afterwards we simply add back to res and continue

### **Python3**

```Python
class Solution:
    def calculate(self, s: str) -> int:
        #math solution without stack
        #Time: O(n)
        #Space: O(1)

        ###summary###
        #Simply go thru the string and add each number to a curr number until we see an operand, 
        #then perform the operation
        #if the operand is a * or / we will have to take a prev number and perform the operation with the cur number
        #afterwards we simply add back to res and continue


        ###explanation###
        #this is simply a twist on the stack solution where we add each cur number to the stack and then 
        #pop when we see an operand and perform the operation. We just add the number into the res right away
        #as for * and /, we just keep a prev num var so we can perform the operation for them in a separate case
        #and pop the prev num from our res. For example  "3+2*2", we simply have a prev of 2 and multiply by 2
        #then add 4 to our res of 3, which prev had a res of 5 but we have to subtract 2 back out of it
        
        #the actual code will proceed with the res, prev, and cur initiated to 0
        #then we will iterate thru each char in s. Two things can happen now, we either add the number into our cur
        #and move down the string until we see an operand. 
        #then we can check the operand we received prev(default initiated to +), and perform the operation
        #if its a * or / we have to perform it on the prev num and take away prev num from the res, 
        #then add the ans back into res
        #the second case is we see an operand or empty space, 
        #we ignore the empty space and simply change cur operand into the operand 
        
        ###pseudocode###
        #initiate i, curr, prev, res to 0
        #initated operand to a default "+"

        #while loop for when i is less than len(s)
            #set a curChar to s at i
            
            ##two conditions, it is either a digit or an operand, we disregard white spaces
            #if curChar is a digit
                #set another while loop for if the cur i char is a digit, and have not reached the end of s
                    #we add the int of cur i char digit to the cur num * 10, multiply by 10 to shift left
                    #increase i because we moved down in s
                #we have to decrease i by 1 here because we shifted 1 space extra in the above loop

                ##now we perform the operations of cur num with cur operand
                #if operand is +
                    #we add cur to our res
                    #and set prev to cur
                
                #if operand is -
                    #we subtract cur to our res
                    #and set prev to -cur
                
                #if operand is *
                    #we subtract prev from res
                    #we add prev * cur to our res

                    #then we set prev to curr * prev, (once we have multiplied they are one digit)
                
                #if operand is /
                    #we subtract prev from res
                    #we add the int(prev / cur) to our res, in python it might round incorrectly so we use int

                    #then set prev to int(prev / cur)
                #we have to set cur back 0 before we go onto our next loop

            #else if curChar is not a white space
                # we set operand to the curChar
            
            #increase i
        
        #return res 

        ###code###
