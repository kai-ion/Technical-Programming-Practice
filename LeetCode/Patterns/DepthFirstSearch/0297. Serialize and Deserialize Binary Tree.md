## [297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/description/)

### Question
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

```
Example:

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
```

### Thinking:
* Method 1: the serialize function is simply a depth first search where we append an N val to the res if the node is null.
    for example in a tree of 1,2,3,null,null,4,5, it will become 1, 2, 3, n, n, 4, 5, n, n

    in the deserialize function, we first split the string into an array of vals by the split(",") function.
    then we can run a dfs on each val.
    the base case is if we see a val as n we will return None so we can set the child of prev node to null.
    else we weill set the current val based on the i pos into a node value. 
    and call dfs again on its left and right child. 
    each time increasing i so we know which pos in the array to set to our node val.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:
    ####summary###
    #time: O(N)
    #Space: O(N)
    #in the serialize function, we can simply call a depth first search 
    #and whenever it is a null node we can append N to res. else we just append and return res at the end

    #in the deserialize function, we also use a depth first search
    #we will take the input string and break it into an array and call the val in the array based on its pos
    #then we will set it to a node and call the dfs for its left and right child

    ###pseudocode###

    #serialize function
        #call an empty res list

        #call a dfs taking in node as parameter
            #base case
            #if not node
                #we append n to res
                #and return
            
            #append the current node.val as a string
            #call dfs of left child
            #call dfs or right child
        
        #call the dfs with node
        #return the res as a string joined by ","

    #deserialize function
        #we breakdown the data with split(",") function into a list
        #we can call a in function local self.i initiated to 0 to keep track of pos of vals

        #call a dfs
            #base case
            #if the val of the ith pos in vals is N, we know this should be an empty node
                #increment i so we move onto the next pos
                #so we return None
            
            #we set the current ith pos val into an int val node
            #then we can increment the ith pos
            #set the nodes left child and as the next dfs
            #same but for right node
            #then we can return the node
        #here we can just return the dfs(), cause at the end of the dfs we return the root of the tree
