## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>A <strong>path</strong> in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence <strong>at most once</strong>. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.</p>

<p>The <strong>path sum</strong> of a path is the sum of the node&#39;s values in the path.</p>

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return <em>the maximum <strong>path sum</strong> of any <strong>non-empty</strong> path</em>.</p>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->
We can use a dfs search on each node to find the max path from its left and right child. Then check if the current subtree
can yield the max path, then return whetern if we should take the left or right subtree path.

### Solution 1: Recursion

When thinking about the classic routine of recursion problems in binary trees, we consider:

1. Termination condition (when to terminate recursion)
2. Recursively process the left and right subtrees
3. Merge the calculation results of the left and right subtrees

For this problem, we design a function $dfs(root)$, which returns the maximum path sum of the binary tree with $root$ as the root node.

The execution logic of the function $dfs(root)$ is as follows:

If $root$ does not exist, then $dfs(root)$ returns $0$;

Otherwise, we recursively calculate the maximum path sum of the left and right subtrees of $root$, denoted as $left$ and $right$. If $left$ is less than $0$, then we set it to $0$, similarly, if $right$ is less than $0$, then we set it to $0$.

Then, we update the answer with $root.val + left + right$. Finally, the function returns $root.val + \max(left, right)$.

In the main function, we call $dfs(root)$ to get the maximum path sum of each node, and the maximum value among them is the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

###Time and Space###

###Explanation###
"""
we can start our dfs from the root node, then we check the base case of if its a Null. If not then we do a recursive call
to find the leftMax path from the left child and rightMax path. However we dont want to take the split path if 
it yields a negative sum, so we can choose to not go by taking 0 if the path yield negative. Then we check the current
subtree patth, which is left path + right Path + nodeVal, to see if its the max path. Then we have our 2nd base case
which is returning nodeVal + max(left, right). Decide if we should split left or right or neither if both negative
