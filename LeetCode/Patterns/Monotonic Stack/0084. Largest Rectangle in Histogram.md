## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

### Solution 1: Monotonic Stack

We can enumerate the height $h$ of each bar as the height of the rectangle. Using a monotonic stack, we find the index $left_i$, $right_i$ of the first bar with a height less than $h$ to the left and right. The area of the rectangle at this time is $h \times (right_i-left_i-1)$. We can find the maximum value.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$. Here, $n$ represents the length of $heights$.

### My thought process

The brute force approach is basically going from left to right and calculate the height from left pointer
to right pointer and moving down in n ^ 2 time
An optimized approach is divide and conquer which is n log n time, which requires you to find the shortest
square to the left and right of current square

There is a method using stacks to achieve n time. We want to maintain a stack that are in increasing order,
then when we see a column that is lower than the stack, we can use it as a base to calculate the max width
by popping from the stack until we can form an increasing order stack with the new column again. Everything that
remains in the stack has a maxArea of from hight * the last recorded index column with a same height.

Common model of monotonic stack: Find the **nearest** number to the left/right of each number that is **larger/smaller** than it. Template:

```python
stk = []
for i in range(n):
    while stk and check(stk[-1], i):
        stk.pop()
    stk.append(i)
```

        ###Explanation###
        """
        we basically want to iterate through the input, and append columns that are of ascending height to the stack.
        The stack will contain a tuple of the start index and current column height. When we encounter a column
        that is not in order, we will pop from the stack and recalculate the max area from current column to the start
        index of the pop stack. We will repeatedly do this until we reach the end of stack or the top of the stack
        can maintain order with the current column. Then we will set the start index of the current column to the 
        start index of the last popped column.
        Afterwards we just have to calculate the area for the remaining columns in the stack that are in order.
        The max area of each column is basically height times the width up to the start column index
