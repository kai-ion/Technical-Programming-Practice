## [380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-delete-getrandom-o1/description/)

### Question
Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average O(1) time.

insert(val): Inserts an item val to the set if not already present.
remove(val): Removes an item val from the set if present.
getRandom: Returns a random element from current set of elements. Each element must have the same probability of being returned.

```
Example:

// Init an empty set.
RandomizedSet randomSet = new RandomizedSet();

// Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomSet.insert(1);

// Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomSet.remove(2);

// Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomSet.insert(2);

// getRandom should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomSet.getRandom();

// Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomSet.remove(1);

// 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomSet.insert(2);

// Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom always return 2.
randomSet.getRandom();
```

### Solution
* Method 1: #initiate a dictionary keeping track of val and where theyre stored on the list. The list will be used for the random function, and we can remove num from the list by getting the index from the dict and swapped with the last val in the list. Then we can simply pop from the list

#### **Python3**
  ```python
class RandomizedSet:
#Dictionary and List solution
#Time: O(1)
#Space: O(n)

###Summary###
#initiate a dictionary keeping track of val and where theyre stored on the list
#The list will be used for the random function, 
#and we can remove num from the list by getting the index from the dict and swapped with the last val in the list
#then we can simply pop from the list

###explanation###
#we will keep a paralel dictionary and a list where the dictionary can help us with inser and remove
#while we can use the list for the getRandom function
#Insert function will just be checking if the val exist in the dict, add it to the dict with the len(list)
#because it should be appended to the end of the list
#in the remove function we will first check if its in the dict, then get the location of the val in the list 
#using the key from the dict, then we will swap the val at the end of the list to the location, 
#and pop the end of the list, and update the dict with the swapped val new location
#then we can simply remove the key from the dict
#then for random function we can just call a built in random function for the list

###pseudo code###
    #in init
        #we will first call a self.numsDict
        #then call a self.numsList
    
    #in insert
        #we first check if its not in the dict and store the res boolean

        ##if its not in the dict then we will have true
        #if res
            #we add it to the dict with a key:val of val : len of list, where len of list is the back of list
            #then we can append val to the back of the list
            

        #we can return the res
    
    #in remove
        #first check if its in the dict and store the res boolean
        ##if its in the dict
        #if res
            #we get the index location of the val from the dict
            #we get the last element of the list
            #we will then set the index location of the list with the last element
            #then we can simply pop the last element from the list
            #update the val in the dict of the last element to the index location
            #then we can delete val from dict

        #return the res

    #in getRandom
        #return random.choice(self.numsList)

    def __init__(self):
        
        self.numsDict = {}
        self.numsList = []
        

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        res = val not in self.numsDict
        if res:
            self.numsDict[val] = len(self.numsList)
            self.numsList.append(val)

        return res
        

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        res = val in self.numsDict
        if res: 
            index = self.numsDict[val]
            lastVal = self.numsList[-1]
            self.numsList[index] = lastVal
            self.numsList.pop()
            self.numsDict[lastVal] = index
            del self.numsDict[val]

        return res
        

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return random.choice(self.numsList)


# Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = RandomizedSet()
# param_1 = obj.insert(val)
# param_2 = obj.remove(val)
# param_3 = obj.getRandom()
