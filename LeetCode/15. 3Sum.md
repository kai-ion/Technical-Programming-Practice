## 15. 3Sum

### Question:
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

* The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

```
Example:

Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

### Thinking:
* Method1: traverse thru the sorted list thru every element, 
            then have two pointers navigating thru the list from front and back
            moving either pointers based on if their sum is greater than the new target
```Python
	class Solution:
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        #two pointer
        ###summary###
        #traverse thru the sorted list thru every element, 
        #then have two pointers navigating thru the list from front and back
        #moving either pointers based on if their sum is greater than the new target

        #Time: O(n^2)
        #Space: O(log n)

        ###explanation###
        #sort the list first
        #iterate thru the list at each index, then keep a high and low pointer start from index + 1
        #while loop for low is less than hi pointer to precisely get the right pointers
        #get a sum of the index and low and hi pointer, take a distance of target subtract by sum, 
        #so we know how far the sum is from target, then we compare the abs val of distance and a diff we been keeping
        #if the distance is less than diff than we update diff 
        #next we move the hi and low pointer based on if sum is less than or greater than target
        #we then need to return the sum but its getting changed, however our value of diff that we kept,
        #can help us find the sum because diff = target - sum, or sum = target - diff by arithmetics 

        ###pseudo code###
        #a diff var initiated to inf
        #sort the nums list

        #iterate thru nums up to len of nums - 2, ## the last two will be the low and hi pointer
            #have a low and hi pointer of index + 1 and the last index which is len(nums) - 1

            #start a while loop for while low is less than high
                #get a sum of index, low, and high pointer
                ##check to see if we have to set a new diff
                #check to see if the abs of this target - sum is less than the abs of our diff var
                    #set diff to target - sum

                ##move the low and high pointers by checking the sum against the target
                #if sum is less than target
                    #we need to move our left pointer
                #else
                    #we move our right pointer
                
            #if we got a diff of 0
                #we can stop the loop as we have found the closest pointer
        #to return the sum of the closest 3 pointers, we simply return target = diff

        ###code###
        diff = float('inf')
        nums.sort()

        for index in range(len(nums) - 2):
            low, high = index + 1, len(nums) - 1
            
            while low < high:
                sum = nums[index] + nums[low] + nums[high]

                if abs(target - sum) < abs(diff):
                    diff = target - sum
                
                if sum < target:
                    low += 1
                else:
                    high -= 1
            
            if diff == 0:
                break
        return target - diff
```
