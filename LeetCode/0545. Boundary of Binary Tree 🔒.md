# [545. Boundary of Binary Tree ðŸ”’](https://leetcode.com/problems/boundary-of-binary-tree)

## Description

<!-- description:start -->

<p>The <strong>boundary</strong> of a binary tree is the concatenation of the <strong>root</strong>, the <strong>left boundary</strong>, the <strong>leaves</strong> ordered from left-to-right, and the <strong>reverse order</strong> of the <strong>right boundary</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>left boundary</strong> is the set of nodes defined by the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The root node&#39;s left child is in the left boundary. If the root does not have a left child, then the left boundary is <strong>empty</strong>.</li>
	<li>If a node in the left boundary and has a left child, then the left child is in the left boundary.</li>
	<li>If a node is in the left boundary, has <strong>no</strong> left child, but has a right child, then the right child is in the left boundary.</li>
	<li>The leftmost leaf is <strong>not</strong> in the left boundary.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>right boundary</strong> is similar to the <strong>left boundary</strong>, except it is the right side of the root&#39;s right subtree. Again, the leaf is <strong>not</strong> part of the <strong>right boundary</strong>, and the <strong>right boundary</strong> is empty if the root does not have a right child.</p>

<p>The <strong>leaves</strong> are nodes that do not have any children. For this problem, the root is <strong>not</strong> a leaf.</p>

<p>Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return <em>the values of its <strong>boundary</strong></em>.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,null,2,3,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,3,4,2]
<b>Explanation:</b>
- The left boundary is empty because the root does not have a left child.
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root&#39;s right child 2 -&gt; 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [2].
- The leaves from left to right are [3,4].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [] + [3,4] + [2] = [1,3,4,2].

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]
<b>Explanation:</b>
- The left boundary follows the path starting from the root&#39;s left child 2 -&gt; 4.
  4 is a leaf, so the left boundary is [2].
- The right boundary follows the path starting from the root&#39;s right child 3 -&gt; 6 -&gt; 10.
  10 is a leaf, so the right boundary is [3,6], and in reverse order is [6,3].
- The leaves from left to right are [4,7,8,9,10].
Concatenating everything results in [1] + [2] + [4,7,8,9,10] + [6,3] = [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>-1000 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions

<!-- solution:start -->

We can take this questions pretty literally, which is just add all the left or right direct subtrees of root(that are
not leaf nodes), then add all the leaf nodes, and add the right directsubtrees in reverse at the end of res.

### Solution 1: DFS

First, if the tree has only one node, we directly return a list with the value of that node.

Otherwise, we can use depth-first search (DFS) to find the left boundary, leaf nodes, and right boundary of the binary tree.

Specifically, we can use a recursive function $\textit{dfs}$ to find these three parts. In the $\textit{dfs}$ function, we need to pass in a list $\textit{nums}$, a node $\textit{root}$, and an integer $\textit{i}$, where $\textit{nums}$ is used to store the current part's node values, and $\textit{root}$ and $\textit{i}$ represent the current node and the type of the current part (left boundary, leaf nodes, or right boundary), respectively.

The function implementation is as follows:

-   If $\textit{root}$ is null, then directly return.
-   If $\textit{i} = 0$, we need to find the left boundary. If $\textit{root}$ is not a leaf node, we add the value of $\textit{root}$ to $\textit{nums}$. If $\textit{root}$ has a left child, we recursively call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, passing in $\textit{nums}$, the left child of $\textit{root}$, and $\textit{i}$. Otherwise, we recursively call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, passing in $\textit{nums}$, the right child of $\textit{root}$, and $\textit{i}$.
-   If $\textit{i} = 1$, we need to find the leaf nodes. If $\textit{root}$ is a leaf node, we add the value of $\textit{root}$ to $\textit{nums}$. Otherwise, we recursively call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, passing in $\textit{nums}$, the left child of $\textit{root}$ and $\textit{i}$, as well as $\textit{nums}$, the right child of $\textit{root}$ and $\textit{i}$.
-   If $\textit{i} = 2$, we need to find the right boundary. If $\textit{root}$ is not a leaf node, we add the value of $\textit{root}$ to $\textit{nums}$. If $\textit{root}$ has a right child, we recursively call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, passing in $\textit{nums}$, the right child of $\textit{root}$, and $\textit{i}$. Otherwise, we recursively call the $\textit{dfs}$ function, passing in $\textit{nums}$, the left child of $\textit{root}$, and $\textit{i}$.

We call the $\textit{dfs}$ function separately to find the left boundary, leaf nodes, and right boundary, and then concatenate these three parts to get the answer.

The time complexity is $O(n)$ and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

#### Python3

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

###Summary###
"""
We can take this questions pretty literally, which is just add all the left or right direct subtrees of root(that are
not leaf nodes), then add all the leaf nodes, and add the right directsubtrees in reverse at the end of res.
"""

###Time and SPace###
"""
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
"""

###Expanation###
"""
So the process is pretty simple, we start with our empty res list. We check if root is None, then we check if the root
node is also a leaf node to add root to our res. We will have 2 helper functions, one function to check if current node
is a leaf node by checking if current node is None and if its children is None. Then we will have another helper function
to add all the leaf nodes to our res. 
We first will process all the left boundary nodes, which is just repeatedly calling the left child node that is not a leaf node
to add to our list, then set the next node to its left child or only child.
Then we add all the leaft nodes using our helper function.
Then we process our right boundary nodes, which is the same as the left boundary except we need it in reverse, so we first
add it to a stack then pop it out later to add to our res
